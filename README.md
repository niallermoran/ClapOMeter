# ClapOMeter
The ClapOMeter is a pretty useless example of some pretty cool technology and quite frankly a bit of fun.

The demo uses an Intel Edison kit with Arduion exapnsion board and Grove Base shield to push sound intenisty data into Azure IoT Hub every second. This data is then read in realtime and displayed on a web dashboard using jQuery calls to a web api that surfaces the data read from the IoT Hub.
